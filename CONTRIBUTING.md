### Pull requests are welcome!
This is still a work in progress, an experiment - if you will, and we'd love your help to make it better! Please file an issue on any major changes you're planning - e.g. "Add new X section", and comment on issues you intend to take on to prevent duplication of effort.

It's also good to make a pull request for any change to the README (minor spelling and wording changes are fine to commit to master). This enables everyone to stay updated on what's going on in the repo. We'll be lax on this in the beginning as we work together to populate this with an initial set of content.
